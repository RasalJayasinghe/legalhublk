## üîÑ Data Sync

LegalHub LK uses an automated GitHub Actions workflow to keep legal documents up-to-date.

### How It Works
- **Schedule**: Runs hourly via GitHub Actions cron job (`0 * * * *`)
- **Manual Trigger**: Can be triggered manually from GitHub Actions tab
- **Data Sources**: Fetches from `nuuuwan/lk_legal_docs_data` repository
- **Processing**: Python script normalizes and optimizes data for frontend consumption
- **Output**: Generates `public/data/catalog.json` (full dataset) and `public/data/latest.json` (latest 100 docs)

### Environment Variables
The sync workflow uses these environment variables:
```bash
SOURCE_BASE=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuuuwan/lk_legal_docs_data/main
SOURCE_ALL=data_1980s_2020s/all.json
SOURCE_LATEST=data_2020s/latest-100.json
OUTPUT_DIR=public/data
```

### Optional External Data Repository
For redundancy, the workflow can push processed data to an external repository if these secrets are configured:
- `LEGALHUB_DATA_REPO`: Target repository (e.g., `username/legalhub-data`)
- `LEGALHUB_DATA_BRANCH`: Target branch (e.g., `main`)
- `GH_PAT`: GitHub Personal Access Token with repo access

### Frontend Integration
The frontend automatically:
1. **Primary**: Loads data from local `/data/catalog.json` and `/data/latest.json` files
2. **Fallback**: Falls back to remote API endpoints if local files are unavailable
3. **Caching**: Implements intelligent caching for optimal performance
4. **Real-time**: Updates immediately when new data is synced

### Data Schema
Documents are normalized to a consistent schema:
```typescript
{
  id: string,
  type: 'Act' | 'Bill' | 'Gazette' | 'Extraordinary Gazette',
  title: string,
  date: string, // ISO format
  languages: string[], // ['en', 'si', 'ta']
  pdf_url: string,
  summary: string,
  source: string
}
```
